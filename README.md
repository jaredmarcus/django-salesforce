## A simple React/Django application that integrates with Salesforce.

This application focuses on high-level design principles and considerations. Below is an outline of the architecture:

1. **Frontend (React):** This is the user interface for the application. We'll use the React library for building the interface, and it might need to be paired with other libraries like Redux for state management, Axios for making HTTP requests, and React-Router for routing.

2. **Backend (Django):** Django, a Python-based framework, will serve as the backend of the application. We'll build and expose a RESTful API with Django Rest Framework (DRF). Your React frontend will consume this API.

3. **Salesforce Integration:** Salesforce provides several APIs (like REST, SOAP, Bulk, Streaming etc.) that your Django backend can use to interact with Salesforce. Salesforce also offers libraries for many languages, but Python isn't as well supported as Java and .NET. There are some community projects like `simple-salesforce` and `salesforce-python` that provide Python interfaces to Salesforce APIs.

Here's a more detailed plan:

**Frontend**

1. **React Components:** Break down the UI into smaller components and build them using React. Each component should ideally be responsible for a single functionality.

2. **State Management:** Use Redux (or the built-in Context API) for global state management.

3. **Routing:** Use react-router for routing and navigation.

4. **API Calls:** Use Axios or Fetch API for making API calls to your Django backend.

**Backend**

1. **Models:** Design Django models based on the application needs. These models will map to our database schema.

2. **Views:** Create your API views using Django Rest Framework. These views will receive HTTP requests from the React frontend, process them, and return responses.

3. **Serializers:** Use DRF serializers for converting complex data types (like Django models) into Python data types (like dicts), which can then be rendered into JSON.

4. **Authentication:** Depending on the requirements, implement an authentication system. Django provides several authentication methods out of the box, but for a React frontend, we'll probably want to use token-based authentication or JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

**Salesforce Integration**

1. **APIs:** Salesforce offers different APIs for different tasks. Based on our needs, we might use one or several of these APIs. For most general purposes, the Salesforce REST API is probably sufficient.

2. **Python Libraries:** We can use `simple-salesforce` or another Python library to interact with the Salesforce APIs. `simple-salesforce` is straightforward to use and has good community support.

3. **Data Syncing:** Syncing data between Salesforce and our Django backend can be tricky. Depending on our needs, we may do a one-time import of data from Salesforce, periodic syncing, or real-time syncing using webhooks or streaming APIs.

**Development Process**

1. **Initial Setup:** Set up React and Django projects. Make sure both can run concurrently and can communicate with each other.

2. **API Development:** Develop our Django API and test it using Postman or another API testing tool.

3. **Frontend Development:** Develop React frontend by building components and making them interact with Django API.

4. **Salesforce Integration:** Once the basic application is working, add the Salesforce integration. Start with simple tasks like reading data from Salesforce, and gradually move to more complex tasks.

Remember that this is a complex project and it's important to have good testing and error-handling strategies in place. It's also crucial to secure any sensitive data, especially when integrating with Salesforce. Always use secure connections (HTTPS), never expose sensitive credentials (like your Salesforce API key), and follow best security practices.

To run this application:

```python
python manage.py runserver
```
